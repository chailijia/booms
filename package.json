  "description": "A high-performance and easy-to-use RPC microservices framework for Node.js, load a directory as a RPC server, call a remote function or method of a remote object like s1.say.hi(), as same as do it at local. Booms can passes not only data, but also callback functions to the server, that's awesome. Booms is based on Node.js native TCP socket. It does not require you to write proto files, which is more easier to use.",
